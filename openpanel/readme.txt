OpenPanel WordPress plugin - Privacy-friendly analytics with ad-blocker resistance. Inline tracking scripts and proxy API calls through your domain.

== Description ==

**OpenPanel** is an open-source web and product analytics platform that serves as a privacy-friendly alternative to traditional analytics solutions. This WordPress plugin seamlessly integrates [OpenPanel](https://openpanel.dev) with your WordPress site while maximizing reliability and avoiding ad-blocker interference.

= Key Features =

* **🚀 Ad-Blocker Resistant**: Serves analytics scripts and API calls from your own domain
* **📊 Real-Time Analytics**: Get instant insights without processing delays
* **🔒 Privacy-Friendly**: Cookie-less tracking that respects user privacy (no cookie banners needed!)
* **⚡ Performance Optimized**: Caches scripts locally and uses efficient proxying
* **🎯 Product Analytics**: Funnel analysis, retention tracking, and conversion metrics
* **📈 Web Analytics**: Visitors, referrals, top pages, devices, sessions, and bounce rates

= How It Works =

This plugin integrates OpenPanel with WordPress in a blocker-resistant way:

* **Inlines** `op1.js` directly into your pages (cached locally for 1 week; falls back to CDN if needed)
* **Bootstraps** the OpenPanel SDK with your Client ID automatically
* **Proxies** all SDK requests through WordPress REST API (`/wp-json/openpanel/`)
* **Preserves** all request methods, headers, query parameters, and body data
* **Handles** CORS properly for cross-origin requests

**Why use a proxy?** Serving scripts and data from your own domain origin avoids third-party blocking and improves tracking reliability significantly.

= Privacy Benefits =

* **🍪 No Cookie Banners Required**: OpenPanel uses cookie-less tracking, so you don't need annoying cookie consent banners
* **🛡️ GDPR Friendly**: Compliant with privacy regulations without requiring user consent for basic analytics
* **🔐 Data Ownership**: You maintain full control over your analytics data
* **🚫 No Personal Data Collection**: Tracks behavior patterns without collecting personally identifiable information

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What is OpenPanel? =
OpenPanel is an open-source web and product analytics platform designed as a privacy-friendly alternative to traditional analytics solutions. It provides real-time insights, funnel analysis, retention tracking, and more while respecting user privacy.

= Where is the proxy endpoint? =
The proxy endpoint is at `/wp-json/openpanel/` (followed by the OpenPanel API path). The SDK automatically points to this endpoint, so all analytics requests go through your WordPress site instead of directly to OpenPanel servers.

= Why do I need this proxy approach? =
Serving analytics scripts and API requests from your own domain significantly reduces blocking by ad-blockers and privacy tools. This improves data collection reliability and ensures more accurate analytics.

= Does it respect CORS and security? =
Yes. The proxy responds with proper CORS headers allowing your site origin and credentials. It also sanitizes all inputs and only forwards legitimate OpenPanel API requests.

= What if inlining `op1.js` fails? =
The plugin automatically falls back to loading the script from the OpenPanel CDN (`https://openpanel.dev/op1.js`) if the local caching fails for any reason.

= How is the script cached? =
The `op1.js` script is cached locally for 1 week using WordPress transients. You can manually clear the cache from the plugin settings page if needed.

= Can I limit tracking to certain users or pages? =
Yes! The plugin includes hooks and checks. For example, tracking is automatically disabled for admin pages. You can extend this by modifying the `inject_inline_sdk()` method or using WordPress filters.

= Will this affect my site performance? =
No, the plugin is designed for minimal performance impact. Scripts are cached locally, loaded asynchronously, and the proxy only handles analytics requests efficiently.

= Do I need to modify my theme? =
No theme modifications are required. The plugin automatically injects the necessary tracking code into all frontend pages.

= Is my data secure? =
Yes. OpenPanel respects privacy by design with cookie-less tracking. Your data ownership is maintained, and you can export or delete data as needed. Since no cookies are used, you don't need cookie consent banners on your site.

= Do I need cookie consent banners with OpenPanel? =
No! OpenPanel uses cookie-less tracking technology, which means no cookies are stored on your visitors' devices. This eliminates the need for cookie consent banners and makes your site GDPR compliant for basic analytics without requiring user consent.

= Where can I get support? =
For plugin-specific issues, use the WordPress plugin support forum. For OpenPanel platform questions, visit [OpenPanel.dev](https://openpanel.dev) or their community channels.
